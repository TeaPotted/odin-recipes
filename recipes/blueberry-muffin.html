        This blueberry muffin recipe is moist, sweet, and bursting with fruity flavor. 
        A buttery streusel topping takes this indulgent breakfast over the top.
    </h2>
    <p>
        This blueberry muffin recipe makes eight extra large and yummy 
        breakfast muffins with a sugary-cinnamon crumb topping.
        I usually double the recipe and fill the muffin cups just to the top for a wonderful, 
        extra-generously-sized, deli-style muffin. Add extra blueberries if you want!
